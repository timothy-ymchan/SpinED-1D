# Spin ED 1D
- Exact diagonalization code for 1D spin chain with nearest-neighbor interactions
- Implemented periodic boundary conditions and crystal momentum conservation
- Implemented total charge conservation (any abelian charge should work, although I only tried $\mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_3$

## Next step
- semi momentum conservation (low priority, my use case does not have parity)
