# Spin ED 1D
- Exact diagonalization code for 1D spin chain with nearest-neighbor interactions
- Implemented periodic boundary conditions and crystal momentum conservation

## Next step
- Implement more symmetries (e.g. $S_n$ or $\mathbb Z_n$ symmetry for spin operators)
- pseudo momentum conservation (low priority, my use case does not have parity)
