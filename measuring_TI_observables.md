# Measuring translational invariant observables 
- Consider an observable $O$ that is translational invariant, i.e. $TOT^{-1}=O$
- Then it is diagonal in momentum space, 
- In other words, we have $\braket{k|O|k'} = \braket{k|T^\dagger O T |k'} = e^{i(k'-k)}\braket{k|O|k'}$
- Therefore, there can only be non-zero overlap whenever $k'=k +2\pi n$. Now $k$ and $k'$ ranges from $-\pi \leq k \leq \pi$ when $L$ is odd, and $-\pi < k \leq \pi$ when $L$ is even.
- Therefore, there are two cases:
- When $L$ is even, then all $k$ sectors decouple. 
- When $L$ is odd, then all $k$ sectors decouple except $\pm \pi$ point.

- For the $A_4$ case, the ground state is always located at the $k=0$ sector, so it is suffice to calculate the operator in that sector.
